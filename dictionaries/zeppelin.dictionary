NUMBERS/ZEPPELIN
1, There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
2, And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
3, When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
4, With a word she can get what she came for.
5, Ooh ooh and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
6, There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
7, 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
8, In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
9, Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
10, Ooh it makes me wonder
11, Ooh it makes me wonder.
12, There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
13, And my spirit is crying for leaving.
14, In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
15, And the voices of those who stand looking.
16, Ooh it makes me wonder
17, Ooh it really makes me wonder.
18, And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
19, Then the piper will lead us to reason.
20, And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
21, And the forests will echo with laughter.
22, If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now
23, It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
24, Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
25, There's still time to change the road you're on.
26, And it makes me wonder.
27, Your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know
28, The piper's calling you to join him
29, Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know
30, Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
31, And as we wind on down the road
32, Our shadows taller than our soul.
33, There walks a lady we all know
34, Who shines white light and wants to show
35, How everything still turns to gold.
36, And if you listen very hard
37, The tune will come to you at last.
38, When all are one and one is all
39, To be a rock and not to roll.
40, And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
