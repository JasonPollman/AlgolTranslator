1		There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
2		And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
3		When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
4		With a word she can get what she came for.
5		Ooh ooh and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
6		There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
7		'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
8		In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
9		Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
10		Ooh it makes me wonder
11		Ooh it makes me wonder.
12		There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
13		And my spirit is crying for leaving.
14		In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
15		And the voices of those who stand looking.
16		Ooh it makes me wonder
17		Ooh it really makes me wonder.
18		And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
19		Then the piper will lead us to reason.
20		And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
21		And the forests will echo with laughter.
22		If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now
23		It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
24		Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
25		There's still time to change the road you're on.
26		And it makes me wonder.
27		Your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know
28		The piper's calling you to join him
29		Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know
30		Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
31		And as we wind on down the road
32		Our shadows taller than our soul.
33		There walks a lady we all know
34		Who shines white light and wants to show
35		How everything still turns to gold.
36		And if you listen very hard
37		The tune will come to you at last.
38		When all are one and one is all
39		To be a rock and not to roll.
40		And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
